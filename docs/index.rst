Continuous Degradation Detection (CODED)
========================================

Continuous Degradation Detection (CODED) is a forest monitoring application developed for mapping and statistically estimating the areas of forests affected by forest degradation. CODED is open source and can run on the `Google Earth Engine`_. CODED can be used to monitor and estimate forest degradation and deforestation. For an overview of the CODED methodology please refer to `Bullock et al., (2020)`_.

Please refer to the following resources for further background information and tutorials for running CODED: 

- `OpenMRV`_: An open-source resource for Forest Measurement, Reporting, and Verification (MRV). One Module in OpenMRV is CODED, with detailed background information, parameter descriptions, and examples using Javascript and a graphical user interface. 
- `E-Learning`_: An interactive course on CODED narrated by Dr. Eric Bullock.
